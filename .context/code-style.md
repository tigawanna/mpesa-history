This is an expo project to build an app to monitor my mpesa history 
I'm more interested in capturing name + number pairs. I don't care about the specifics of the transaction.

I prefer:
- TypeScript
- Named functions
- If styles have less than 3 properties, inline them instead of using StyleSheet

Using:
- React Native Paper for components and styling
- Legend State for theme/global state management
- React Hook Form for form handling

The app will store contacts locally using Legend State's persist feature.
